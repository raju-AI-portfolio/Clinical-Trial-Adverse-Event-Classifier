# 1️⃣ Baseline Assumptions (Large Pharma Operations)

## Annual Trial Volume

- Active clinical trials: **50**
- Average AEs per trial: **3,000**

### Total AEs per Year

```
50 × 3,000 = 150,000 AEs
```

---

## Current Manual Effort

- Avg time per AE (triage + MedDRA coding + QC): **20 minutes**

### Total Manual Hours

```
150,000 × 20 minutes = 3,000,000 minutes
= 50,000 hours
```

---

## Blended Labor Cost

- Safety case processors
- PV scientists
- QC reviewers

**Fully loaded cost: $80/hour**

---

## Current Annual Manual Cost

```
50,000 hours × $80 = $4,000,000 per year
```

---

# 2️⃣ Impact of AI-Powered AE Classifier

## Conservative AI Performance

- 50% time reduction per AE
- Human review retained
- No automated medical judgment
- Regulatory-safe implementation

---

## New Effort

- New time per AE: **10 minutes**

### New Total Hours

```
150,000 × 10 minutes = 25,000 hours
```

---

## Direct Labor Savings

```
25,000 hours × $80 = $2,000,000 per year
```

✅ Hard, defensible savings.

---

# 3️⃣ Additional Business Value (Often Larger Than Labor)

## A. Faster Safety Signal Detection

Assumption:
- Prevents 1 major protocol amendment per year

Typical cost of amendment:
- $300,000 – $600,000  
Use conservative estimate:

```
$300,000
```

---

## B. Reduced Trial Delays

Avoiding 1-week delay in 1 Phase III trial:

Industry average delay cost:
- $100,000/day (conservative)

```
$100,000 × 5 days = $500,000
```

---

## C. Improved Inspection Readiness

Value drivers:
- Fewer audit findings
- Lower remediation effort
- Reduced regulatory exposure

Conservative annual value:

```
$200,000
```

---

## Total Additional Value

```
$300,000
+ $500,000
+ $200,000
= $1,000,000 per year
```

# 6️⃣ ROI Calculation

## Year 1

### Total Benefit

```
$3,000,000
```

### Total Cost

```
$1,100,000 + $500,000 = $1,600,000
```

### Net Benefit

```
$3,000,000 - $1,600,000 = $1,400,000
```

---

## ROI Formula

```
ROI = (Net Benefit / Total Cost) × 100
ROI = (1,400,000 / 1,600,000) × 100
≈ 87.5%
```

---

## Payback Period

Estimated payback:

```
6–8 months
```

---

# 7️⃣ Year 2+ ROI (Where It Becomes Highly Attractive)

No one-time costs remain.

### Annual Benefit

```
$3,000,000
```

### Annual Cost

```
$500,000
```

### Net Annual Value

```
$2,500,000
```

---

## Ongoing ROI

```
ROI = (2,500,000 / 500,000) × 100
= 500%
```

---

# 8️⃣ Executive Messaging (Leadership-Ready Narrative)

### Key Positioning

The largest value driver is earlier signal detection and improved inspection readiness — not just labor reduction."

---

## Emphasize

- Conservative assumptions
- Compliance-first design
- No automation of medical judgment
- Human-in-the-loop model
- Portfolio-level scalability
- Risk mitigation benefits
