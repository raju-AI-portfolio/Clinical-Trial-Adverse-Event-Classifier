# Clinical-Trial-Adverse-Event-Classifier
ROI Calculation: Clinical Trial Adverse Event Classifier
1. Baseline Assumptions (Typical Large Pharma Trial Ops)
These are industry-realistic, not inflated.
Trial & Operations Scale (Annual)
•	Active clinical trials: 50
•	Average AEs per trial: 3,000
•	Total AEs per year:
50 × 3,000 = 150,000 AEs
 
Current Manual Effort
•	Avg time per AE (triage + MedDRA coding + QC): 20 minutes
•	Total manual hours:
•	150,000 × 20 min = 3,000,000 minutes
•	= 50,000 hours
 
Cost per Hour (Blended)
•	Safety case processors, PV scientists, QC
•	Fully loaded cost ≈ $80/hour
Annual Manual Cost
50,000 × $80 = $4,000,000 per year
 
2. Impact of AI-Powered AE Classifier
Conservative AI Performance (Regulatory-safe)
•	Time reduction per AE: 50%
•	Human review still required
•	No auto-submission
New Effort
•	Time per AE: 10 minutes
•	New total hours:
•	150,000 × 10 min = 25,000 hours
 
Direct Labor Savings
25,000 hours × $80 = $2,000,000 per year
✅ Hard, defensible cost savings
 
3. Additional Business Value (Often Bigger Than Labor)
A. Faster Safety Signal Detection
Assumption
•	Earlier detection prevents 1 major protocol amendment / year
Typical cost of a protocol amendment:
•	$300k – $600k
Use conservative: $300,000
 
B. Reduced Trial Delays
If faster AE processing avoids:
•	1-week delay in 1 Phase III trial
Cost of Phase III delay (industry avg):
•	~$100k–$200k/day
Use conservative: $100k/day × 5 days = $500,000
 
C. Improved Inspection Readiness
Hard to monetize, but:
•	Fewer audit findings
•	Reduced remediation effort
Conservative annual value: $200,000
 
Total Additional Value
$300,000 + $500,000 + $200,000
= $1,000,000 per year
 
4. Total Annual Benefit
Category	Annual Value
Labor savings	$2,000,000
Operational & risk reduction	$1,000,000
Total Benefit	$3,000,000
 
5. Investment Cost (Year 1)
One-Time Costs
Item	Cost
Data preparation & labeling	$300,000
Model development & validation	$400,000
GxP documentation & IQ/OQ/PQ	$200,000
Integration (CTMS, safety systems)	$200,000
Total One-Time	$1,100,000
 
Annual Run Costs
Item	Cost
Cloud & inference	$200,000
Monitoring & retraining	$150,000
Support & governance	$150,000
Total Annual Run	$500,000
 
6. ROI Calculation
Year 1
Total Benefit: $3,000,000
Total Cost: $1,100,000 + $500,000 = $1,600,000
Net Benefit: $1,400,000
ROI Formula
ROI = (Net Benefit / Total Cost) × 100
ROI = (1.4M / 1.6M) × 100 ≈ 87.5%
 
Payback Period
Payback ≈ 6–8 months
 
7. Year 2+ ROI (Where It Gets Very Attractive)
No one-time costs anymore.
Annual Benefit: $3,000,000
Annual Cost: $500,000
Net Annual Value: $2,500,000
Ongoing ROI
ROI = (2.5M / 0.5M) × 100 = 500%
